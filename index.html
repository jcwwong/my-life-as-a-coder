				<h2>There once was a girl stuck in a TV...</h2>

				<p class="black-text">
					“Aahh! Where am I…wait is that my couch? Why’s it so big” A young teenaged girl starts darting towards her giant sized couch only to slam straight into cold hard glass.  
					<br/>

					“What the… “ She looks around and finds she’s in a uniform grey coloured room with no doors and one wall being glass looking straight through to her oversized living room.  A moment later a mystical being forms out from the left wall and starts floating towards her. “Oh my gosh, what are you? Stay away from me!” screamed the girl. The mystical being throws a book at her which opens to a blank white page with the words  "<span class="italic">Choose a topic</span>" written on it.  “Choose a topic? I am so confused, what is happening? How do I get out of here and why is my furniture so large out there” cries the teenaged girl. “Wait a minute! Am I… Am I stuck inside my television?”  
					<br/>
					<br/> 

					Seconds later the being next to her starts screeching at high-pitched volumes. “AAHHH STOP IT STOP IT” she yells and this time the text appears in bold on the page, underneath its duplicate "<span class="italic-bold">Choose a topic</span>". With the screeching blasting in her ears she quickly screams out “SCIENCE!” but the discorded noises still continue to shriek. The words disappear from the page and instead chemical equations appear with blank spaces, waiting to be filled out. She picks up the book lying on the ground, still opened at the same page. There is a pen resting on the ground where the book once was, which she hadn’t noticed before. She picks it up and starts filling the gaps on the page and finally the clump of matter stops its high-pitched screeching and starts morphing into a desk and chair. The newly formed furniture start shaking against the ground, as if urging her to sit down. She sits and works, praying the noise doesn't return.  She is lost, she is confused, she is afraid, afraid of this transforming monster she’s sitting on. She does not know where she is, what she’s doing there, all she knows is she trapped and must continue to fill out this book or the noise starts again.
					<br/>
					<br/> 
					 
					The timing is sporadic, sometimes she feels like she has hours, other times minutes, sometimes seconds until the screeching resumes. She actually has plenty of ‘breaks’ but they’re useless as she dreads returning to that horrid book. She’s sick of studying science, had she had known what choosing a topic would mean in that split second she would’ve picked something much more enjoyable. She uses her ‘breaks’ to find ways out, searching for gaps and crevices between the glass and the wall, any holes, but to no avail.  So she continues the tedious grind.
					With what feels like years later, the pages suddenly turn blank and the book vanishes into thin air. Instead a laptop materialises with 3 symbols on it, a body, some teeth and an eye. There is a timer going down from 10.. 9.. 8.. 7..  She’s now so conditioned to act fast to avoid the deafening cacophony, she swiftly clicks the eye and this time more text and questions appear but this time on the laptop screen with content only relating to optometry. “Noooo, not more science, something else please!” But 4 long years go by and the now young lady is exhausted and extremely bored. Sometimes during her time off, she risks exploring her laptop functions just to kill her boredom. No screeches yet. There’s not much on the laptop, just the basics on the screen. No games, no external applications. After years of probing she figures out she can play around with Terminal to access the operating system.
					<br/> 
					<br/> 

					One day, huge block numbers shaped ”<span class="block-letter">$70,000</span>” suddenly start to emerge from that same left wall and begin chasing her, she screams and runs trying to avoid the enormous wooden form from bulldozing her over. As she’s drained, she doesn't get far and the wooden blocks catch up. But instead of running her over, it latches onto her leg and chains itself to her. 
					The heavy bulk weighs down her every move.  “I need to get out!” she wails and starts desperately slamming on the glass for the millionth time as if she’d never done so in the many years gone by. Yet the same glass view of her living room, now layered with dust stares back in silence.  As she settles down and returns to her laptop, fed up with studying, she continues on Terminal and suddenly a key pops up. “What does this mean? Is this finally a way out?” A portal appears out of nowhere on that same left wall.  She rushes towards the portal and runs straight through it, only to land straight back on the chair with the laptop screen, an open Terminal window and that key symbol glaring back at her. Maybe she can try coding her way out of this strange space...

				<h2> Introduction
				</h2>

				<p> My name is Jessica Wong and I’m very excited to start my career as a coder. As an optometrist with a University of Melbourne Biomedicine Degree, I have an inquisitive mind and have grown to be an effective communicator due to my highly interactive profession. I trust that my passion for analysing patterns and comprehensively understanding situations will help me accomplish challenges as a coder. I have a tendency to get lost in projects, ponder ideas, am resourceful and motivated to thoroughly do the research which is why I think I’d be really suitable to do well in this course. I understand it is an intense fast paced course. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				If I were to be  accepted, I would be dedicated to learning and expanding my skills in coding, working closely with your mentors and support network. With any career change, I am aware there will be moments that are extra challenging, but based on past experiences I’ve shown to be resilient and hard working enough to get through it. These traits have gotten me to where I am as an optometrist, for example working in the country and overcoming the first time having to use a syringe needle to dig a metal foreign material out from a patient’s eye, 3 months after graduating which was never practised during my studies. I believe my diverse background will enrich team projects by giving valuable and at times counter-intuitive insight and creativity. I have a strong fascination in learning how things work and am open minded, I embrace new ideas and am very receptive towards new innovative ways of getting tasks done.

				<h2> A Little Bit about My Background:
				</h2>

				<p> I have been working as an optometrist for some time now but honestly don’t think it’s the profession for me. I went into optometry with an interest to help people see and feel fulfilled and rewarded gifting people clear vision but I’ve come to realise the industry does not support my curious nature as most of our work doesn’t allow me to engage in thought provoking challenges but rather involves in detecting issues to then send off for someone else to fix. Building products that clients end up using genuinely excites me and would be a rewarding experience. As technology is always changing, the dynamic work content will feed my appetite to learn, the work of a software developer provides opportunities which can provoke my curious mind and challenge me where I feel optometry is lacking. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Technology has always been something I’ve had growing up. With an older brother, I would always be playing computer games on MAME32 with him and my male cousins. This is probably where my interest in solving problems using computers first sparked. So far I’ve tried to learn to code myself, ardently searching for an avenue to make that career change. In my own attempts to take up coding, I have learned to explore files and folders using command prompt, researched the different data types in coding, looked into manipulating some data types using JavaScript methods, and to write HTML and CSS. I have lots of family and friends who are currently software developers, some have successfully completed courses from Coder Academy who have recommended this career to me.

				<h2> My Hobbies and Interests
				</h2>

				

				<p> Outside of work, I have many hobbies which include, travelling, hiking, doing puzzles, playing boardgames, photography, editing photos with Adobe Lightroom, reading fantasy novels, bouldering and occasionally playing the piano and guitar. I love learning new skills such as hang gliding and snowboarding.
